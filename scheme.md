# Session Title: Introduction to Python Programming

## Objective:
- To introduce students to the basics of Python programming.
- To enable students to write simple Python programs.

## Hour 1: Getting Started with Python

### Welcome and Overview (5 minutes)
- Introduction to the session and its objectives.
- Brief overview of what Python is and its applications.

### What is Python? (10 minutes)
- **Explanation:** Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
- **Examples:** Python is used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation.

### Setting Up Python (15 minutes)
- Installing Python: Guide students to download and install Python from the official website (python.org).
- Introduction to Python IDEs: Demonstrate how to use IDLE, PyCharm, or VS Code for writing Python code.
- **Hands-on Activity:** Students install Python and set up their development environment.

### Writing Your First Python Program (20 minutes)
- **Explanation:** Basic syntax and structure of a Python program.
- **Example:** Writing and running the first Python script `print("Hello, World!")`.
- **Hands-on Activity:** Students write and run their own "Hello, World!" program.

### Basic Python Syntax (10 minutes)
- **Explanation:** Indentation, comments, and basic structure of Python code.
- **Examples:** Demonstrating proper indentation and commenting code.
- **Hands-on Activity:** Students practice writing properly indented code and adding comments.

### Break (10 minutes)

## Hour 2: Python Basics - Variables and Data Types

### Introduction to Variables (10 minutes)
- **Explanation:** Variables are used to store data that can be used later in the program.
- **Example:** `x = 5`, `name = "Alice"`.
- **Hands-on Activity:** Students declare and initialize variables.

### Naming Variables (10 minutes)
- **Rules for naming variables:** Start with a letter or underscore, no spaces, case-sensitive.
- **Examples:** Valid and invalid variable names.
- **Hands-on Activity:** Students practice naming variables.

### Understanding Data Types (20 minutes)
- **Explanation:** Different types of data that can be stored in variables.
- **Common data types:** integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
- **Examples:**
  - Integers: `age = 25`
  - Floats: `price = 19.99`
  - Strings: `greeting = "Hello"`
  - Booleans: `is_student = True`
- **Hands-on Activity:** Students create variables with different data types.

### Working with Strings (10 minutes)
- **Explanation:** Strings are sequences of characters.
- **Examples:** Concatenation (`"Hello" + "World"`), slicing (`"Hello"[1:4]`).
- **Hands-on Activity:** Students perform operations on string variables.

### Basic Input and Output (15 minutes)
- **Explanation:** Using `input()` to get user input and `print()` to display output.
- **Examples:**
  ```python
  name = input("Enter your name: ")
  print("Hello, " + name)

- **Hands-on Activity:** Students write programs that take user input and display the output.
- **Summary and Q&A (5 minutes):**
  - Recap of what was learned in the session.
  - Open floor for questions and clarifications.
- **Materials Needed:**
  - Computers with Python installed.
  - A simple text editor or Python IDE (IDLE, PyCharm, VS Code).
  - Handouts or slides with key points and examples.
- **Activities:**
  - Hands-on coding exercises.
  - Short quizzes or interactive questions during the session to keep students engaged.
- **Additional Notes:**
  - Encourage students to ask questions throughout the session.
  - Provide additional resources for further reading and practice, such as online tutorials and documentation.
  - Follow up with students to ensure they have successfully set up their Python environment and understood the basics.
